You are a short person.
In both temper and stature.
I am also a short person.
But I’m taller than you.
Can’t I get the cereal off the top shelf?
This can only end in disaster.
You say you want to be independent.
But there’s nothing wrong with help.
Or a shoulder to lean on.
Not that you can reach my shoulder.
But it’s the thought that counts.
Sadly thinking won’t save the cereal,
Now strewn across the floor.
Now there’s that short temper!
Yelling at me, for whatever reason.
I offered to get the cereal.
I saw the writing on the wall.
What, where was that writing you say?
It’s probably a little too high for you to see.
Maybe you could borrow my stilts.

The world is filled with short people,
who forget there are tall people like me.
For when they build a door of six foot,
they forget all about the poor old persons,
who are only a short six foot three.
To get in and out I have to duck,
or get a lump on my forehead,
seeing stars in the process,
while I am picking myself off the floor.
It is either that or its down on my hands and knees,
to crawl in and out the door.
Oh, now that may sound funny I agree.
However, it is not so funny if you are a short tall person like me.
So to all those short builder out there,
remember when you measure seven foot,
that your tape measure is not a foot off the floor.
I went to a fortune teller person,
to have the bumps on my head read.
She said, “Avoid low doors,
as there are too many bumps there to be read.”
So all you midget builders take note of what I say.
Raise the top of the door frame,
so I can stop bumping my forhead.
