You are a short person.
In both temper and stature.
I am also a short person.
But I’m taller than you.
Can’t I get the cereal off the top shelf?
This can only end in disaster.
You say you want to be independent.
But there’s nothing wrong with help.
Or a shoulder to lean on.
Not that you can reach my shoulder.
But it’s the thought that counts.
Sadly thinking won’t save the cereal,
Now strewn across the floor.
Now there’s that short temper!
Yelling at me, for whatever reason.
I offered to get the cereal.
I saw the writing on the wall.
What, where was that writing you say?
It’s probably a little too high for you to see.
